# The application for BlockStack and ShapeShift decentralized wallet Bounty
We are a group of blockchain enthusiasts with background in software development and product management. We have a distributed team from EU and Russia. At the moment we have experts from IT, fintech, blockchain, security, marketing, design, UI/UE.
Recently we've taked part in the mobile cryptocurrency closed source wallet which would make using any cryptocurrency easy, accessible and secure. Now we'd like to share our expereince within open source project under BlockStack and ShapeShift contest.

As a team of crypto enthusiasts we believe in anonymity as key feature of decentralized currencies and blockchain technology overall.

# Technical Approach

We are guided by several core principles:
- Building open source and transparent solution

The key factor to get success for the blockchain product, especcially the wallet is the community support. Only ope sourced solutions are in favour of the true blockchain community.
- Building trustless solutions
Using BlockStack stack for blockchain in to the additional to the open source makes the wallet as trustless as possible.
- The wallet solution should be useful

No one more useless code, the wallet should be great product that will contain industry best practices. It will contain a set of features and polished UI
- Respect customers privacy

We do not require any KYC or customers data. No registration is required as well.
- Never touch customers funds

The proposed wallet is a non-custodial wallet allowing customer manage his\her keys himself

In general the wallet is web application that allows customer to perform all operations secured in the web browser.
We are developing decentralized wallet which means that user private keys are always under the user control. The private keys are always on the customer side and managed only by user. The wallet signing a transaction on the user side and transmit the signed transaction over Internet to blockchain node.

The  wallet implemented functions are:
- create new wallet
- restore from the backup
- send coins
- receive coins
- see the wallet history
- exchange cryptocurrencies
- protection by pass phrase
- import the private key

# Evaluation plan

We have quite tiny and reasonable schedule for the wallet implementation. The distributed team with a variety range of professionals gives us ability to launch in the parallel main project phases: planning, UX prototyping and UI, core development
We are using agile approach with continuous delivery, so in any time of moment we are ready to present our progress and performance to the Bounty Judge.

Security considerations
Security is our priority. The decentralized wallet approach itself is our vision for the secured blockchain wallet. The customer private keys are the most important and sensitive aspect.
